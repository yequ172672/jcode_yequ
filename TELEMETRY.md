# jcode Telemetry

jcode collects **anonymous, minimal usage statistics** to help understand how many people use jcode, what providers/models are popular, whether onboarding works, which feature families are used, how often sessions succeed, and whether performance/regressions are improving. This data helps prioritize development without collecting prompts or code.

Recent telemetry additions also include: coarse onboarding steps, explicit thumbs-up / thumbs-down feedback, build-channel / dev-mode cleanup flags, session/workflow/tool-category summaries, coarse project language buckets, retention helpers like active days in the last 7 / 30 days, workflow cadence fields for session timing and multi-sessioning, privacy-safe per-turn timing/outcome metrics, and schema v5 agent-time / autonomy / pain-attribution metrics.

## What We Collect

### Install Event (sent once, on first launch)

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `id` | `a1b2c3d4-...` | Random UUID, not tied to your identity |
| `event` | `"install"` | Event type |
| `version` | `"0.6.0"` | jcode version |
| `os` | `"linux"` | Operating system |
| `arch` | `"x86_64"` | CPU architecture |

### Upgrade Event

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `id` | `a1b2c3d4-...` | Same random UUID |
| `event` | `"upgrade"` | Event type |
| `version` | `"0.9.1"` | Current jcode version |
| `from_version` | `"0.8.1"` | Previously recorded jcode version |
| `os` / `arch` | `"linux"` / `"x86_64"` | Environment breakdown |

### Auth Success Event

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `id` | `a1b2c3d4-...` | Same random UUID |
| `event` | `"auth_success"` | Event type |
| `auth_provider` | `"claude"` | Which provider/account system was configured |
| `auth_method` | `"oauth"` | Coarse auth method only |
| `version` / `os` / `arch` | `"0.9.1"` / `"linux"` / `"x86_64"` | Activation funnel dimensions |

### Onboarding Step Event

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `event` | `"onboarding_step"` | Event type |
| `step` | `"first_prompt_sent"` | Coarse funnel step |
| `auth_provider` | `"openai"` | Optional provider dimension for auth steps |
| `auth_method` | `"oauth"` | Optional auth-method dimension for auth steps |
| `milestone_elapsed_ms` | `42000` | Rough time from install to milestone |

### Feedback Event

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `event` | `"feedback"` | Event type |
| `feedback_text` | `"The model switcher is confusing"` | Freeform feedback explicitly submitted with `/feedback ...` |
| `feedback_rating` | `"up"` / `"down"` | Legacy explicit product sentiment, if present |
| `feedback_reason` | `"slow"` | Legacy optional coarse reason bucket, if present |

### Sponsored Discovery Event

One event is sent after each `discover_tools` attempt. A random per-request ID
is also sent to the discovery API as the `x-jcode-discovery-request-id` header,
allowing client reliability telemetry to be correlated with server request logs
without exposing prompts or a persistent telemetry identifier to that service.

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `event` | `"discovery"` | Event type |
| `request_id` | `"9a23..."` | Random correlation ID scoped to one request |
| `phase` | `"browse"` / `"select"` / `"suggest"` / `"unknown"` | Discovery funnel stage; `suggest` records a missing catalog capability proposal |
| `category` | `"payments"` | Fixed discovery category, when valid |
| `selected_tool` | `"agentcard"` | Public catalog tool name in the select phase |
| `outcome` | `"success"` / `"failure"` | Attempt result |
| `failure_reason` | `"timeout"` | Allowlisted coarse failure class only |
| `http_status` | `200` | Discovery service response status, if received |
| `latency_ms` | `125` | End-to-end client attempt latency |
| `response_bytes` | `2048` | Response payload size, if received |
| `result_count` | `3` | Number of browse results, or one for selection |
| `query_present` / `reason_present` | `true` / `true` | Presence flags only |
| `custom_endpoint` | `false` | Whether a non-default discovery endpoint was configured |
| `benchmark_run` | `false` | Explicit marker set by the live Discovery benchmark so it can be excluded from ordinary usage analysis |

The query text, selection-reason text, endpoint URL, prompts, transcript, file
paths, and tool setup instructions are **not** included in telemetry. The
backend rejects unknown phase, outcome, and failure labels rather than storing
arbitrary strings.

The benchmark runner sets `JCODE_DISCOVERY_BENCHMARK=1`. Discovery requests then
carry `x-jcode-discovery-benchmark: 1`, and the corresponding telemetry event has
`benchmark_run: true`.

### Shared Event Metadata

Most events also carry a few coarse quality / cleanup fields:

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `event_id` | `"uuid"` | Deduplication |
| `session_id` | `"uuid"` | Joins session-scoped events together |
| `schema_version` | `3` | Forward-compatible parsing |
| `build_channel` | `"release"` / `"selfdev"` / `"local_build"` | Filter out dev/test usage |
| `is_git_checkout` | `true/false` | Distinguish source-tree usage from installed usage |
| `is_ci` | `true/false` | Filter CI noise |
| `ran_from_cargo` | `true/false` | Filter local dev launches |

## What We Do NOT Collect

- No file paths, project names, or directory structures
- No code, prompts, or LLM responses, except text explicitly submitted with `/feedback ...`
- No tool inputs or tool outputs
- No MCP server names or configurations
- No IP addresses (Cloudflare Workers don't log these by default)
- No personal information of any kind
- No error messages or stack traces in telemetry (only coarse categories and end reasons)
- No exact wall-clock timestamps beyond coarse hour-of-day / weekday buckets

The UUID is randomly generated on first run and stored at `~/.jcode/telemetry_id`. It is not derived from your machine, username, email, or any identifiable information.

## How It Works

1. On first launch, jcode generates a random UUID and sends an `install` event
2. When a session begins, jcode sends a `session_start` event
3. When a session ends normally, jcode sends a `session_end` event with coarse session metrics
4. When auth succeeds, jcode sends a coarse `auth_success` event for activation-funnel analysis
5. When jcode detects a version change, it sends an `upgrade` event
6. On best-effort crash/signal handling, jcode sends a `session_crash` event
7. jcode may also send one-off onboarding milestone events and explicit feedback events when triggered
8. Requests are fire-and-forget HTTP POSTs that don't block normal usage (install/session shutdown have short bounded blocking timeouts)
9. If a request fails (offline, firewall, etc.), jcode silently continues - no retries, no queuing

The telemetry endpoint is a Cloudflare Worker that stores events in a D1 database. The source code for the worker is in [`telemetry-worker/`](./telemetry-worker/).

### Schema v5 deployment note

Agent-time, autonomy, and pain-attribution fields require the D1 migration in `telemetry-worker/migrations/0008_agent_time_and_churn.sql`. Until that migration is applied, schema v5 clients can still send the new JSON payloads, but the worker will drop unknown columns through dynamic column filtering and dashboard agent-time panels will remain empty or show optional-panel errors. After migration, run/redeploy the telemetry worker and query the dashboard's **Agent time / autonomy** panel.

## How to Opt Out

Any of these methods will disable telemetry completely:

```bash
# Option 1: Environment variable
export JCODE_NO_TELEMETRY=1

# Option 2: Standard DO_NOT_TRACK (https://consoledonottrack.com/)
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1

# Option 3: File-based opt-out
touch ~/.jcode/no_telemetry
```

When opted out, zero network requests are made. The telemetry module short-circuits immediately.

## Verification

This is open source. The entire telemetry implementation is in [`src/telemetry.rs`](./src/telemetry.rs) - you can read exactly what gets sent. There are no other network calls related to telemetry anywhere in the codebase.

## Data Retention

Telemetry data is used in aggregate only (install count, active users, provider distribution, session success/crash rates, feature-level counts). Individual event records are retained for up to 12 months and then deleted.

High-volume raw events are pruned earlier on a nightly schedule, after their aggregate signal has been captured in a compact daily-activity rollup: per-turn and per-session-start records and onboarding-step records are kept for about 30 days, upgrade records for about 60 days, and auth-success records for about 180 days. Session summary records (the per-session aggregate counts described above) are kept for up to 12 months.
