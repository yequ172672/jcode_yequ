# Compile Performance Plan

This document tracks the plan to make jcode's self-dev / refactor loop much faster
without sacrificing full-feature builds.

See also:

- [`COMPILE_TIME_ISOLATION_REFACTOR.md`](./COMPILE_TIME_ISOLATION_REFACTOR.md)
- [`REFACTORING.md`](./REFACTORING.md)
- [`MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE_RFC.md`](./MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE_RFC.md)

## Goals

- Keep full-featured builds available for normal usage and self-dev reloads.
- Make common self-dev edits significantly cheaper to compile.
- Reduce how often customizations require recompilation at all.
- Measure improvements after each phase and stop churn that does not pay off.

## Current Baseline (2026-03-24)

Measured locally on the current tree:

- Warm `cargo check --quiet`: **~8.5s**
- Warm `scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --release -p jcode --bin jcode --quiet`: **~47.3s**

Additional observations from this audit:

- A previous warm-ish `cargo check` run landed around **~12.3s**.
- A less-warm `cargo check --timings` run landed around **~23.8s**.
- The previous local default `clang + mold` setup failed during release linking on this machine.
- `clang + lld` links the release `jcode` binary successfully here.

## Near-Term Targets

For common self-dev edits that do **not** touch broad shared interfaces:

- Warm `cargo check`: **< 5s**
- Warm `cargo build` / reload-oriented build: **< 20–30s**

For shared/core edits we should still aim to stay materially below today's baseline,
even if they cannot reach the same fast path.

## What Matters Most (ranked)

1. **Workspace / crate boundaries**
   - Rust caches best at the crate boundary.
   - Heavy untouched subsystems should remain compiled and reusable in full builds.
2. **Good boundary design**
   - High-churn logic should not live in broad fanout crates or unstable shared types.
3. **`sccache`**
   - Practical win for repeated local builds and CI.
4. **Fast, reliable linker configuration**
   - Especially important for `cargo build` and release/self-dev reload builds.
5. **Heavy subsystem isolation**
   - Embeddings, provider implementations, and large TUI/rendering code should stop
     churning unrelated builds.
6. **Narrower build targets for inner loops**
   - Avoid rebuilding extra bins/targets when not needed.
7. **Reduce the need to recompile at all**
   - Issue #32's customization records and extension points should make many changes
     config/hook/skill/data driven rather than source driven.

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1 — Tactical build speed wins

- Keep `.cargo/config.toml` conservative for local contributors.
- Use `scripts/dev_cargo.sh` for local self-dev builds:
  - enables `sccache` automatically if installed
  - prefers `clang + lld` on Linux x86_64
  - uses the dedicated Cargo `selfdev` profile for `jcode` self-dev build/reload paths
  - can still opt into `mold` via `JCODE_FAST_LINKER=mold`
- Route refactor-shadow builds through that wrapper.

### Phase 2 — Measurement and repeatability

Standard self-dev checkpoints now live behind `scripts/bench_selfdev_checkpoints.sh`, which runs:
- cold `cargo check`
- warm touched-file `cargo check`
- cold self-dev `jcode` build
- warm touched-file self-dev `jcode` build

Use it when capturing comparable before/after numbers for refactors.

- Add documented commands for cold/warm `check` and `build` timing.
- Prefer touched-file timings (for example `scripts/bench_compile.sh check --touch src/server.rs`) over no-op hot-cache reruns when judging ROI.
- Track timing deltas after each structural phase.
- Fix build/link blockers before treating any timing data as authoritative.
- 2026-03-25: upgraded `scripts/bench_compile.sh` to support repeated runs, summary stats,
  JSON output, and extra cargo-arg passthrough so compile-speed work can use consistent
  touched-file measurements instead of one-off ad hoc timings.
- 2026-03-25: upgraded `scripts/dev_cargo.sh` with `--print-setup` plus clearer cache/linker
  diagnostics so developers can confirm whether `sccache` / fast-linker paths are actually active.
- 2026-03-30: removed the per-build `build.rs` timestamp/build-number churn from local source
  builds. `JCODE_VERSION` for source builds is now stable per `Cargo.toml` version + git hash,
  while UI/version build-time display comes from the binary mtime at runtime. Validation on this
  machine: two no-op release-jcode runs measured **221.688s then 0.559s**, confirming the main
  crate no longer recompiles just because build metadata changed.
- 2026-04-09: introduced a dedicated Cargo `selfdev` profile for self-dev iteration. On this
  machine, the warm local `jcode` self-dev build path dropped from about **56.1s** for
  `scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --release -p jcode --bin jcode --quiet` to about **16.0s** for
  `scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --profile selfdev -p jcode --bin jcode --quiet`, while keeping the
  normal release/distribution profile unchanged.
- 2026-04-18: added `scripts/bench_selfdev_checkpoints.sh` to standardize cold/warm self-dev
  checkpoints. First local checkpoint attempt on this machine surfaced two environment blockers:
  - cold checkpoints failed because `cargo clean` could not remove part of `target/release`
    (`Permission denied` on a fingerprint timestamp file)
  - warm `selfdev-jcode` touched-file measurement on `src/tool/read.rs` failed because the
    `sccache`-wrapped rustc process terminated with signal 15 during the `jcode` crate build
  - warm touched-file `cargo check` on `src/tool/read.rs` completed in **93.115s** then **9.430s**,
    which is useful as a rough upper/lower bound but not yet stable enough to treat as an
    authoritative checkpoint
  - follow-up required: fix the `target/release` permission issue, rerun cold checkpoints, and
    rerun warm self-dev measurements until they are stable enough to compare against future waves
- 2026-04-18: updated `scripts/bench_selfdev_checkpoints.sh` to keep running after individual
  checkpoint failures and report them in JSON/text output instead of aborting early. Verified local
  output on this machine with `--touch src/tool/read.rs --runs 1`:
  - warm touched-file `cargo check`: **9.582s**
  - warm touched-file `selfdev-jcode` build: **59.898s**
  - failed checkpoints reported cleanly: `cold_check`, `cold_selfdev_build`
- 2026-04-18: added `--skip-cold` to `scripts/bench_selfdev_checkpoints.sh` so warm-only
  checkpoints remain usable while cold-path cleanup is blocked locally. Verified local output on this
  machine with `--skip-cold --touch src/tool/read.rs --runs 1`:
  - warm touched-file `cargo check`: **9.339s**
  - warm touched-file `selfdev-jcode` build: **18.844s**
  - skipped checkpoints reported explicitly: `cold_check`, `cold_selfdev_build`
- 2026-04-18: additional warm-only checkpoint on a broader shared edit target with
  `--skip-cold --touch src/server.rs --runs 1`:
  - warm touched-file `cargo check`: **8.711s**
  - warm touched-file `selfdev-jcode` build: **18.969s**
- 2026-04-18: additional warm-only checkpoint on a heavy tool-path file with
  `--skip-cold --touch src/tool/communicate.rs --runs 1`:
  - warm touched-file `cargo check`: **8.496s**
  - warm touched-file `selfdev-jcode` build: **21.400s**
- 2026-04-18: additional warm-only checkpoint on a provider-heavy file with
  `--skip-cold --touch src/provider/openai.rs --runs 1`:
  - warm touched-file `cargo check`: **8.750s**
  - warm touched-file `selfdev-jcode` build: **21.386s**
- 2026-04-18: additional warm-only checkpoint on the shared provider module with
  `--skip-cold --touch src/provider/mod.rs --runs 1`:
  - warm touched-file `cargo check`: **9.772s**
  - warm touched-file `selfdev-jcode` build: **17.917s**
- 2026-04-18: additional warm-only checkpoint on the agent entry module with
  `--skip-cold --touch src/agent.rs --runs 1`:
  - warm touched-file `cargo check`: **7.318s**
  - warm touched-file `selfdev-jcode` build: **30.928s**
- 2026-04-18: additional warm-only checkpoint on the memory tool with
  `--skip-cold --touch src/tool/memory.rs --runs 1`:
  - warm touched-file `cargo check`: **7.787s**
  - warm touched-file `selfdev-jcode` build: **12.798s**
- 2026-04-18: additional warm-only checkpoint on session search with
  `--skip-cold --touch src/tool/session_search.rs --runs 1`:
  - warm touched-file `cargo check`: **7.009s**
  - warm touched-file `selfdev-jcode` build: **12.874s**
- 2026-04-18: additional warm-only checkpoint on the browser tool with
  `--skip-cold --touch src/tool/browser.rs --runs 1`:
  - warm touched-file `cargo check`: **13.693s**
  - warm touched-file `selfdev-jcode` build: **18.874s**
- 2026-04-28: diagnosed the repeated self-dev `jcode` lib build `SIGTERM` on this 16 GiB,
  no-swap workstation. `journalctl -u earlyoom` showed earlyoom sending `SIGTERM` to the root
  `rustc` when available memory crossed the 10% threshold. A direct no-`sccache` build reproduced
  the same signal, so `sccache` was only reporting the termination. `scripts/dev_cargo.sh` now
  enables adaptive low-memory overrides for `--profile selfdev` when Linux + earlyoom + no swap +
  <24 GiB RAM + <8 GiB currently available RAM are detected: `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1`,
  `CARGO_PROFILE_SELFDEV_INCREMENTAL=true`, and `CARGO_PROFILE_SELFDEV_CODEGEN_UNITS=256`. Use
  `JCODE_SELFDEV_LOW_MEMORY=off` to disable, or `JCODE_SELFDEV_LOW_MEMORY=on` to force. Initial
  validation completed under the earlier settings in **2m34s** after an interrupted partial build
  reused artifacts; a later benchmark with 9.4 GiB available showed that preserving the inherited
  selfdev profile can reduce warm edit builds from about **60s** to about **14s** when there is
  enough headroom.
- 2026-05-21: rechecked the same failure mode during overnight TUI test triage. `journalctl -u
  earlyoom` showed repeated `SIGTERM` events against root `jcode` `rustc` processes at about
  **2.7-3.3 GiB RSS**. `CARGO_PROFILE_SELFDEV_CODEGEN_UNITS=16` still failed under current browser
  and desktop-session memory pressure, while a direct no-`sccache` selfdev build with incremental
  enabled and `CARGO_PROFILE_SELFDEV_CODEGEN_UNITS=256` completed. The adaptive low-memory default
  was changed to match that passing profile, disables `sccache` by default because `sccache`
  rejects Cargo incremental builds, and `scripts/dev_cargo.sh` now honors `SCCACHE_DISABLE=1`
  before auto-enabling the wrapper. Fresh lib-test compilation remains heavier than the binary
  build and may still require a remote builder, more free memory, or swap.
- 2026-05-05: trimmed root compile surface by replacing broad `tokio/full` with explicit used
  features, aligning Jcode-owned `crossterm` dependencies on 0.29, and replacing `qr2term` with
  direct `qrcode` rendering. This removed the duplicate `crossterm 0.28` path from the `jcode`
  tree while preserving login QR output. Validation: `cargo check --profile selfdev -p jcode --bin
  jcode`, `cargo test --profile selfdev login_qr --lib -- --nocapture`, and coordinated
  `selfdev build` passed.
- 2026-05-05: removed unused `reqwest/blocking` from `jcode-provider-core`; static search showed
  no blocking API usage in that crate. Validation: `cargo check --profile selfdev -p
  jcode-provider-core` and full `cargo check --profile selfdev -p jcode --bin jcode` passed.
- 2026-05-03: added `JCODE_DEV_FEATURE_PROFILE` to `scripts/dev_cargo.sh` so compile-speed probes and
  narrow inner-loop builds can consistently select feature sets without repeating Cargo flags. Profiles:
  `default`, `minimal`/`none` (`--no-default-features`), `pdf` (`--no-default-features --features pdf`),
  `embeddings` (`--no-default-features --features embeddings`), and `full` (`--features embeddings,pdf`).
  The wrapper leaves explicit `--features` / `--no-default-features` cargo args untouched. Validation on
  this machine: `JCODE_DEV_FEATURE_PROFILE=minimal scripts/dev_cargo.sh check -p jcode --lib --quiet` passed.
- 2026-05-03: disabled Cargo auto-discovery for root binary targets and moved developer-only helper
  binaries (`tui_bench`, `session_memory_bench`, `mermaid_side_panel_probe`) behind the opt-in
  `dev-bins` feature. This keeps broad normal checks focused on production/test targets while preserving
  explicit probe coverage via `cargo check --all-targets -p jcode --features dev-bins`. Validation showed
  `cargo check --all-targets -p jcode` skips those three bins, while adding `--features dev-bins` includes them.
- 2026-05-03: moved the self-dev build/version/channel support implementation out of the root crate and
  into `crates/jcode-build-support`, leaving `src/build.rs` as a re-export facade. This cuts another
  stable, high-fanout support subsystem out of the root compile unit while preserving existing call sites
  (`crate::build::*`). Validation: `cargo check -p jcode-build-support`, `cargo test -p jcode-build-support`,
  and `cargo check -p jcode --lib` passed during the split.
- 2026-05-03: moved the pure keybinding parser/matcher/types from `src/tui/keybind.rs` into
  `jcode-tui-core::keybind`, leaving root TUI config-loading wrappers in place. This creates a reusable
  cache boundary for a low-coupling TUI helper module while preserving the existing `crate::tui::keybind::*`
  API. Validation: `cargo check -p jcode-tui-core`, `cargo test -p jcode-tui-core`, and
  `cargo check -p jcode --lib` passed.

Warm-only touched-file checkpoints captured so far on this machine:

| Touched file | Warm `cargo check` | Warm `selfdev-jcode` build |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `src/tool/session_search.rs` | 7.009s | 12.874s |
| `src/agent.rs` | 7.318s | 30.928s |
| `src/tool/memory.rs` | 7.787s | 12.798s |
| `src/tool/communicate.rs` | 8.496s | 21.400s |
| `src/server.rs` | 8.711s | 18.969s |
| `src/provider/openai.rs` | 8.750s | 21.386s |
| `src/tool/read.rs` | 9.339s | 18.844s |
| `src/provider/mod.rs` | 9.772s | 17.917s |
| `src/tool/browser.rs` | 13.693s | 18.874s |

Observed spread from these warm-only checkpoints:
- warm touched-file `cargo check`: **7.009s to 13.693s**
- warm touched-file `selfdev-jcode` build: **12.798s to 30.928s**
- fastest measured warm self-dev rebuilds so far are on smaller tool-path edits
- `src/agent.rs` currently stands out as the most expensive warm self-dev rebuild in this sample set
- `src/tool/browser.rs` currently stands out as the slowest warm `cargo check` in this sample set

### Phase 3 — Workspace boundary design

The refined layered target, dependency rules, and migration guidance live in
[`docs/MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE_RFC.md`](MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE_RFC.md). The crate list
below is the compile-performance-oriented destination sketch and should be read
as compatible with that RFC, not as the only acceptable final packaging.

Proposed destination layout:

- `jcode-core`
  - protocol, ids, message types, config primitives, shared utility types
- `jcode-server`
  - server lifecycle, reload, socket, swarm, daemon behaviors
- `jcode-agent`
  - agent turn loop, tool orchestration, stream handling
- `jcode-provider`
  - provider traits, shared provider types, routing/catalog support
- `jcode-embedding`
  - embedding model integration and related heavy inference dependencies
- `jcode-tui`
  - TUI rendering, widgets, state reduction, terminal UI support
- `jcode-tui-core`
  - low-level TUI helpers with minimal root coupling, including stream buffers and keybinding parsing
- `jcode-selfdev`
  - customization records, migration logic, self-dev productization
- `jcode-build-support`
  - self-dev build commands, source-state fingerprints, binary channel paths/manifests

### Phase 4 — First crate splits

Start with the highest-leverage cache boundaries:

1. `jcode-embedding`
2. provider support / provider implementation splits
3. self-dev/customization system once the new extension-point work lands
4. server / agent split along the seams already being extracted

### Phase 4a — First workspace boundary landed

- 2026-03-24: moved the heavy ONNX/tokenizer implementation into the new
  `crates/jcode-embedding` workspace crate.
- The main `src/embedding.rs` module now acts as a facade for process-local
  cache/stats/path/logging integration.
- This preserves the public `crate::embedding` API while creating a real Cargo
  cache boundary for the heaviest embedding dependencies.
- Follow-up: gather more realistic before/after timing data using controlled
  touched-file benchmarks rather than fully hot no-op rebuilds.
- 2026-05-05: made the `embeddings` feature opt-in instead of part of default
  features for faster ordinary `cargo check` / `cargo build` loops.
- 2026-05-23: reverted that default-feature split because embedding-backed
  memory recall and semantic retrieval should work out of the box in normal
  builds. Default builds now enable both `pdf` and `embeddings`; developers who
  need compile-speed probes can use `JCODE_DEV_FEATURE_PROFILE=minimal` or
  `JCODE_DEV_FEATURE_PROFILE=pdf` to skip the local inference stack. Full local
  inference remains available explicitly via `--features embeddings` or
  `JCODE_DEV_FEATURE_PROFILE=full` when testing non-default feature paths.
  Validation target: `cargo tree -p jcode --edges normal --depth 1` should
  include both `jcode-pdf` and `jcode-embedding`; `--no-default-features` should
  include neither.

- 2026-03-24: moved PDF extraction behind the new `crates/jcode-pdf` workspace
  crate and fixed the `--no-default-features` build path by making PDF support
  degrade gracefully when the feature is disabled.

- 2026-03-24: moved Azure bearer-token retrieval behind the new
  `crates/jcode-azure-auth` workspace crate so the Azure SDK no longer lives
  directly in the main crate.
- Note: touched-file timing for `src/auth/azure.rs` needs more instrumentation
  cleanup; one post-split sample was anomalous and should not be treated as a
  trustworthy ROI datapoint yet.

- 2026-03-24: moved email notification / IMAP reply transport behind the new
  `crates/jcode-notify-email` workspace crate.
- The main `src/notifications.rs` module now keeps the higher-level ambient,
  safety, and channel integration while SMTP/IMAP/mail parsing lives behind a
  dedicated crate boundary.
- This split is primarily meant to keep `lettre`, `imap`, `mail-parser`, and
  `native-tls` out of unrelated self-dev rebuilds; edits to `notifications.rs`
  itself still invalidate the main crate and are not the right sole ROI metric.

- 2026-03-25: landed the first provider boundary slice with
  `crates/jcode-provider-metadata`.
- Boundary decision: provider **metadata / profile catalogs / pure selection helpers** move into
  their own crate first, while env mutation, config-file I/O, and runtime integration remain in
  `src/provider_catalog.rs` as a facade.
- This is intentionally narrower than a full `Provider` trait split: it creates a real provider-side
  compile boundary without prematurely dragging streaming/message/runtime dependencies into a shared
  crate that would likely stay high-churn.

- 2026-03-25: landed the next provider-core slice with `crates/jcode-provider-core`.
- Boundary decision: move **shared HTTP client + route/cost/core provider value types** first,
  but keep the `Provider` trait itself in `src/provider/mod.rs` for now.
- Reason: the trait currently still mixes in `message.rs`, runtime/auth behavior, and provider-specific
  streaming/compaction concerns; moving it too early would likely create a noisy, still-high-churn core crate.

- 2026-03-25: landed the first provider-implementation support crate with
  `crates/jcode-provider-openrouter`.
- Boundary decision: move **OpenRouter-specific model catalog / endpoint cache / provider ranking /
  model-spec parsing support** into a dedicated crate, while keeping the actual `Provider` trait impl,
  auth wiring, and message/stream translation in `src/provider/openrouter.rs`.
- Reason: this creates a real provider-implementation compile boundary now, without introducing a crate
  cycle through `Provider`, `EventStream`, or `message.rs`.

- 2026-03-25: landed the next provider-implementation support crate with
  `crates/jcode-provider-gemini`.
- Boundary decision: move **Gemini Code Assist schema/types, model-list constants, and pure support helpers**
  into a dedicated crate, while keeping the actual `Provider` trait impl, auth calls, and runtime/network orchestration
  in `src/provider/gemini.rs`.
- Reason: this creates another real provider-side compile boundary without forcing the `Provider` / `EventStream`
  seam prematurely.

- 2026-03-30: moved the pure OpenAI tool-schema normalization helpers into
  `crates/jcode-provider-core/src/openai_schema.rs`.
- Boundary decision: move **pure schema adaptation / strict-normalization helpers** first, while keeping
  `build_tools(...)` and request-history rewriting in `src/provider/openai_request.rs` because those still depend on
  local tool/message types.
- Reason: this creates another provider-side cache boundary now without prematurely pulling `Message`, `ToolDefinition`,
  or the `Provider` trait into a shared crate.

- 2026-05-05: moved provider catalog-refresh diffing into
  `jcode-provider-core::catalog_refresh` and re-exported it from the root provider facade.
- Boundary decision: move the pure `ModelRoute` summary/diff logic first because it has no root-crate
  auth/runtime/config dependencies.
- 2026-05-05: split the stable provider pricing tables/helpers into
  `jcode-provider-core::pricing`, leaving `src/provider/pricing.rs` as a thin facade for root-only
  auth/env/OpenRouter-cache lookups.
- Reason: provider pricing is relatively stable table/math code, but it previously lived in the main crate
  beside high-churn provider runtime code. This creates a reusable cache boundary without moving the
  `Provider` trait or network implementations prematurely.
- Validation: `cargo test -p jcode-provider-core --quiet`, `cargo test -p jcode pricing:: --quiet`,
  `cargo check -p jcode --quiet`, and `cargo check -p jcode --features embeddings --quiet` pass.
- 2026-05-05: moved provider failover prompt/decision/classifier contracts and provider
  selection/fallback-order contracts into `jcode-provider-core`, leaving root provider modules as
  facades for env/runtime/account state. This continues shrinking `src/provider/mod.rs` support
  surfaces toward an eventual `jcode-provider` runtime crate.
- Validation: `cargo test -p jcode-provider-core --quiet`, focused root provider selection/failover
  tests, and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.
- 2026-05-05: moved the Copilot `PremiumMode` provider-control enum into `jcode-provider-core`
  and re-exported it from the root/Copilot facades. The `Provider` trait no longer needs to name
  the root `copilot` module for this control surface.
- Validation: `cargo check -p jcode-provider-core --quiet` and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.
- 2026-05-05: moved provider-native tool result DTOs/sender aliases into `jcode-provider-core`.
  The global `Provider` trait no longer has to expose types owned by the root Claude module.
- Validation: `cargo check -p jcode-provider-core --quiet` and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.
- 2026-05-05: moved stable provider model constants, static provider/model classification,
  Copilot model-name normalization, and fallback context-window heuristics into
  `jcode-provider-core::models`. Root `src/provider/models.rs` now layers dynamic account catalogs,
  runtime availability, and cache hydration on top of those core helpers.
- Validation: `cargo test -p jcode-provider-core models:: --quiet`,
  `cargo check -p jcode-provider-core --quiet`, and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.
- 2026-05-05: moved the global `Provider` trait and `EventStream` alias into `jcode-provider-core`.
  Root `src/provider/mod.rs` now re-exports the contract while continuing to own concrete provider
  implementations and `MultiProvider` composition. This is the main provider seam needed before a
  future `jcode-provider` runtime crate can be introduced safely.
- Validation: `cargo check -p jcode-provider-core --quiet` and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.
- Warm-only touched-file benchmark on `src/provider/mod.rs` after the provider-core seam: first
  self-dev build was a noisy artifact-producing **140.739s**, then the immediate rerun measured
  **12.101s** warm `cargo check` and **27.433s** warm self-dev build. Treat the rerun as the
  comparable steady-state datapoint.

- 2026-05-05: moved the stable provider-facing `ToolDefinition` contract from `src/message.rs` into
  `jcode-message-types` and re-exported it from the root message facade. This is a prerequisite for
  shrinking the provider trait and tool registry surfaces away from root-crate-only message types.
- Validation: `cargo test -p jcode-message-types --quiet` and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.
- 2026-05-05: introduced `jcode-tool-types` for stable tool execution output DTOs and moved
  `ToolOutput` / `ToolImage` out of `src/tool/mod.rs`. Root tool modules continue using the same
  names via a facade re-export, but provider/agent/server seams can now depend on a narrow tool
  result contract without depending on the root tool registry.
- Validation: `cargo check -p jcode-tool-types --quiet`, `cargo test -p jcode-tool-types --quiet`,
  and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.
- 2026-05-05: added `jcode-tool-core` for runtime tool contracts and moved `Tool`, `ToolContext`,
  `ToolExecutionMode`, and `StdinInputRequest` out of `src/tool/mod.rs`. `jcode-tool-types` stays
  DTO-only, while channel/runtime-bearing context lives in the runtime-contract crate instead of
  contaminating pure type crates.
- 2026-05-05: also moved the shared tool intent schema helper into `jcode-tool-core`, keeping the
  root `src/tool/mod.rs` module focused on registry composition rather than shared schema contracts.
- Validation: `cargo check -p jcode-tool-core --quiet`, `cargo check -p jcode-tool-types --quiet`,
  and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.
- 2026-05-05: moved provider streaming contracts `StreamEvent` and `ConnectionPhase` from
  `src/message.rs` into `jcode-message-types`, again preserving root facade re-exports. Together
  with `ToolDefinition`, this materially reduces the root-only surface of the provider trait and
  prepares a future `jcode-provider` crate.
- Validation: `cargo check -p jcode-message-types --quiet`, `cargo test -p jcode-message-types --quiet`,
  and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.
- 2026-05-05: moved core conversation DTOs `Message`, `ContentBlock`, `Role`, and `CacheControl`
  into `jcode-message-types`, while keeping root-only redaction/generated-image/session helpers in
  `src/message.rs`. Provider and agent contracts can now refer to message data through the lower
  type crate rather than the root crate facade.
- Validation: `cargo check -p jcode-message-types --quiet`, `cargo test -p jcode-message-types --quiet`,
  and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.
- 2026-05-05: moved pure message helpers for fresh-user-turn detection, stable message hashing,
  tool ID sanitization, and the missing-tool-output constant into `jcode-message-types`. Root keeps
  secret redaction and generated-image visual context because those still depend on regex/env/fs/base64
  integration details.
- Validation: `cargo check -p jcode-message-types --quiet`, focused root message helper tests, and
  `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.
- 2026-05-05: moved the provider split-system dynamic-context insertion helper and its tests into
  `jcode-message-types`. This removes another pure message transformation from `src/provider/mod.rs`
  and keeps preparing the provider trait for an eventual runtime crate split.
- Validation: `cargo test -p jcode-message-types dynamic_context --quiet`,
  `cargo check -p jcode-message-types --quiet`, and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.

- 2026-05-05: moved the server lightweight-control request classifier from
  `src/server/client_lifecycle.rs` into `jcode-protocol::Request::is_lightweight_control_request`.
  This is a small but directionally important server seam: protocol-shape policy belongs with the
  protocol contract, while the large client lifecycle module keeps runtime dispatch.
- Validation: `cargo check -p jcode-protocol --quiet` and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.
- 2026-05-05: moved swarm task-control action parsing, assignment-message formatting, and status
  eligibility/error policy from `src/server/comm_control.rs` into `jcode-plan`. This keeps plan/task
  policy next to the plan graph/status helpers and leaves server comm control focused on runtime I/O
  and mutation orchestration.
- Validation: `cargo test -p jcode-plan --quiet` and `cargo check -p jcode --quiet` pass.

- 2026-03-30: moved the workspace-map subsystem into the new `crates/jcode-tui-workspace` crate.
- Boundary decision: move **workspace map data/model + widget rendering** first, while keeping the surrounding
  `info_widget`, app state, and higher-level TUI composition in the main crate.
- Reason: this is a safe first `jcode-tui` foothold because the workspace map code is already mostly self-contained and
  avoids the much riskier `App` / renderer / markdown / mermaid seams.

### Phase 5 — Reduce invalidation pressure

- Continue shrinking giant hotspot files.
- Keep high-churn code out of stable low-level crates.
- Avoid changing shared broad fanout types casually.

### Phase 6 — Reduce recompilation demand via issue #32

- Store customization intent, provenance, validation, and migration hints.
- Add extension points so more user changes live in:
  - config
  - hooks
  - skills
  - prompt overlays
  - routing/theme/layout data
- Prefer those over direct Rust source edits whenever possible.
- 2026-03-30: landed the first prompt-overlay seam for system-prompt customization without a rebuild.
  jcode now loads `~/.jcode/prompt-overlay.md` and `./.jcode/prompt-overlay.md` into the
  static prompt, which is a low-risk first step toward the broader issue #32 customization plan.

## Scenario Measurements (2026-03-24)

Touched-file `cargo check` samples gathered during this batch:

- `src/server.rs`: ~8.7s
- `src/tool/read.rs`: ~8.8s
- `src/auth/azure.rs` before Azure crate split: ~7.0s
- `src/provider/openrouter.rs` before Azure crate split: ~6.5s
- `src/provider/openrouter.rs` after Azure crate split: ~6.0s
- `src/notifications.rs` after notification-email crate split: ~11.4s
- `src/channel.rs` after notification-email crate split: ~4.8s
- `src/provider_catalog.rs` after provider-metadata split: ~5.8s
- `src/provider/mod.rs` after provider-core type split: ~50.1s
- `src/provider/openrouter.rs` after openrouter-support crate split: ~5.6s
- `src/provider/gemini.rs` after gemini-support crate split: ~5.5s

Notes:

- The post-split touched-file measurement for `src/auth/azure.rs` produced an anomalous
  result and should not be treated as a reliable ROI datapoint yet.
- The post-split `src/notifications.rs` timing is not by itself a negative signal: touching
  that root module still rebuilds the main crate, while the intended win is that unrelated edits
  stop dragging mail transport dependencies through the same compile unit.
- No-op fully hot-cache reruns can look unrealistically fast; use touched-file scenarios
  when evaluating structural compile-speed changes.
- Provider metadata timings should be interpreted as a first provider-side foothold, not the final
  provider ROI story; the larger wins should come from future provider-core / implementation splits.
- The `src/provider/mod.rs` touched-file timing remains high because touching that root file still rebuilds the
  main crate and the auth/runtime-heavy trait logic. This stage is about carving out stable reusable pieces first,
  not claiming that the provider root is solved.
- The `src/provider/openrouter.rs` touched-file sample is more encouraging because the heavy OpenRouter-specific
  catalog/ranking/cache support now lives in its own crate while the main module stays a thinner wrapper.
- The `src/provider/gemini.rs` touched-file sample is similarly encouraging: the serde-heavy Code Assist schema and
  pure model-list/support helpers now live outside the main crate while the runtime wrapper remains local.

## Dependency Hygiene Wins (2026-03-24)

- `global-hotkey` is now gated behind `target_os = "macos"` instead of being compiled on all
  platforms.
- This is a smaller win than a crate split, but it removes an unnecessary dependency subtree from
  Linux self-dev builds because the hotkey listener implementation is macOS-only.
- Validation: on Linux, `cargo tree -i global-hotkey` is now empty.

## Next-Boundary Assessment

The next obvious heavy dependency boundaries are less clearly safe/local than the ones already landed:

- provider support remains high-value, but `src/provider/mod.rs` and related implementations are
  broad enough that the next split should be designed carefully instead of rushed.
- a future `jcode-provider-core` / provider-implementation split is still the most promising next
  compile-speed move, but it needs boundary design first so high-churn shared types do not create
  a new invalidation hotspot.

Current provider-boundary stance:

- **Done:** `jcode-provider-metadata` for stable login/profile catalog data and pure selection logic.
- **Done:** `jcode-provider-core` for shared HTTP client plus route/cost/core provider value types.
- **Done:** `jcode-provider-openrouter` for OpenRouter-specific catalog/cache/ranking/model-spec support.
- **Done:** `jcode-provider-gemini` for Gemini Code Assist schema/types and pure model support helpers.
- **Done:** `jcode-provider-core::openai_schema` for pure OpenAI schema adaptation / strict-normalization helpers.
- **Not done yet:** `Provider` trait / `EventStream` extraction and fully independent provider impl crates.
- **Reason:** the trait side still depends on `message.rs`, auth flows, runtime behavior, and provider-specific
  streaming logic; the current staged split avoids turning that unstable seam into a low-value high-churn crate.

That means the best next batch should likely target either:
- a carefully designed trait seam, or
- another provider implementation support split with similarly clean boundaries.

Current TUI-boundary stance:

- **Done:** `jcode-tui-workspace` for workspace-map model + widget rendering.
- **Not done yet:** broader `jcode-tui` extraction for markdown, mermaid, info widgets, and the shared renderer.
- **Reason:** the remaining high-value TUI files are larger but still more tightly coupled to `App`, config, images,
  side-panel state, and rendering orchestration, so they need staged extraction rather than a rushed top-level split.

## Root-Crate Decomposition Strategy (2026-05-29)

The previous splits created many `*-types` / `*-core` crates that the root re-exports from, but
`scripts/analyze_root_crate.py` shows **334K of 336K root-crate lines are still genuinely in-root**:
the heavy logic stayed behind thin facades. The analyzer (committed alongside this section) gives the
objective map needed to finish the job. Run it any time:

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_root_crate.py          # ranked modules + blockers + cycles + feedback arcs
python3 scripts/analyze_root_crate.py --full    # full feedback-arc-set listing
python3 scripts/analyze_root_crate.py --json     # machine-readable
```

### The core problem: one giant dependency cycle

The library-only module graph (test code excluded) has a single **strongly-connected component of 42
modules / ~310K lines (92% of the crate)**: `tui, server, provider, tool, cli, auth, agent, session, …`.
You cannot peel `tui`/`server`/`provider` into independent crates while they mutually reference each
other. This is *the* structural blocker, and it is why "just move the big dirs out" never works.

### The good news: the cycle is shallow

The 42-module cycle is held together by only **46 back-edges totaling 178 references**, and most are
single-reference "accidental" couplings. Breaking this small feedback arc set turns the graph into a
DAG, after which modules peel off bottom-up. Cheapest-first (from the analyzer):

- **1-ref edges (≈24 of them):** e.g. `agent -> tui` (one `write_generated_image_side_panel_page` call),
  `tool -> tui` (one `tui::image::display_image` import), `config -> auth`, `config -> tool`,
  `telemetry -> cli`, `bus -> provider`, `browser -> provider`. Each is a single call/import that can move
  to a shared lower-level crate or be inverted behind a trait/callback.
- **Mid-weight edges:** `usage -> auth` (4), `tool -> provider` (5), `tool -> server` (5),
  `sidecar -> provider` (7), `agent -> tool` (9), `import -> tui` (9), `usage -> provider` (9).
- **Heavy structural seams (design carefully):** `agent -> provider` (20), `cli -> tui` (21),
  `auth -> provider` (39). These are the genuine architectural couplings worth a trait seam.

### Execution order (bottom-up, DAG-first)

1. **Baseline metrics.** Record peak rustc RSS for the largest current unit and full-build wall time
   (`scripts/bench_compile.sh`), so each extraction's memory/compile win is measurable.
2. **Break the cheap back-edges first.** Eliminate the 1-2 ref couplings (image helpers, single config
   lookups, telemetry/cli) by moving shared primitives down into existing low-level crates
   (`jcode-core`, `jcode-tui-*`) or inverting them behind small traits. Re-run the analyzer; watch the
   SCC shrink.
3. **Extract already-clean leaves.** Modules the analyzer marks "extractable now" (no in-root blockers):
   `background`, `prompt`, `safety`, `transport`, `replay`, `browser`, `perf`, plus the many <400 loc
   leaves. These need no cycle-breaking and immediately shrink the root crate.
4. **Address the heavy seams** (`auth↔provider`, `cli↔tui`, `agent↔provider`) with deliberate trait
   boundaries once the cheap edges are gone.
5. **Lift the big subsystems** (`tool` 29K, `provider` 35K, `server` 38K, then `tui` 125K) once they are
   no longer in the cycle. `tui` goes last: almost nothing depends on it (sink of the DAG), so once its
   own outbound deps are crates it lifts cleanly and removes the single largest compilation unit.

### Why this directly reduces compile memory

rustc holds an entire crate's IR in memory at its codegen peak, so peak RSS scales with the size of the
largest compilation unit. Today that unit is the 336K-line root crate (~2.5-3 GiB/process). Every module
moved into its own crate shrinks the largest unit, lowering peak per-process RSS, which is exactly what
lets more parallel jobs run without OOM (complementing the memory-adaptive job count above). It also
sharpens incremental caching: editing one file rebuilds one small crate instead of the whole monolith.

## Results: Phases A/B/C (2026-05-29) and the stop decision

The monolithic root crate was physically split into a strict downward DAG of separately-compiled
crates. Each is its own rustc unit, so each type-checks/codegens independently and the global peak
per-process memory is the max over units (not their sum).

```
jcode (root: cli + bin)        depends on
  -> jcode-tui (tui + video_export)   depends on
       -> jcode-app-core (server/tool/agent SCC + leaves)  depends on
            -> jcode-base (provider/auth/config/session/message/memory foundation)
```

Ground-truth per-rustc peak `VmHWM` (selfdev profile, single-job, `/tmp/peakrss2.sh`):

| unit | peak VmHWM | note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| monolith (before) | **3.18 GiB** | the unit that OOM-killed the 15 GB/no-swap machine |
| jcode-base | 1.126 GiB | FLOOR: bottom crate, fewest internal deps |
| jcode-app-core | 1.176 GiB | base + 0.050 |
| jcode-tui | 1.280 GiB | app-core + 0.104 (98K loc adds only +0.104) |
| jcode (root cli) | 0.664 GiB | thin shell, fast incremental for cli iteration |

**Outcome: largest single compilation unit 3.18 -> 1.28 GiB (-60%).** No unit exceeds ~1.3 GiB, so the
memory-adaptive job limiter can schedule parallel rustc jobs without OOM. Commits: `4dd91a9c` (Phase A),
`4aec863e` (Phase B), `f649daeb` (test import), `85c96735` (Phase C jcode-tui), `2591c0e5` (test-support
feature restoring cross-crate `#[cfg(test)]` helpers). Full `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` is
clean.

### Why we STOPPED here (the Stop Conditions above)

A further split of `jcode-tui` (the current 1.280 GiB max) was analyzed and deliberately **not** done:

- **It is feasible but low-value.** The render layer already depends on a 106-method `TuiState` trait
  (`ui::draw(frame, app: &dyn TuiState)`), not the concrete `App`; production back-edges from render
  modules into `app` are essentially nil (one `ui_input.rs` use of two pure helpers/consts), so a clean
  `app` vs `render` cut exists.
- **But the peak is floor-bound, not tui-bound.** `jcode-base` alone is already 1.126 GiB because every
  crate inherits the same external-dep monomorphization (serde/tokio/reqwest/ratatui). tui's entire 98K
  loc adds only +0.104 over app-core, so splitting it into ~49K halves would shave only ~30-50 MB and
  **cannot** reach the "<1.13 GiB" target, which is structurally pinned by the base floor.
- **It adds real maintenance cost:** partitioning the 1535-line `mod.rs` glue (view-model types
  `DisplayMessage`/`ToolCall`/`ProcessingStatus`/`TuiState` itself) and extending every feature-forwarding
  chain (jemalloc/embeddings/pdf/test-support) by another hop.

Per the Stop Conditions, continuing high-churn refactors on compile-memory grounds alone is not justified
once the binding peak is the shared base floor. The remaining levers (lower the floor itself) are profile-
level (codegen-units/debuginfo) or dependency-level (trim/feature-gate heavy external deps), not further
crate carving.

## Results: incremental-rebuild fixes (2026-05-29)

After the structural split, the inner-loop wall time was attributed with `cargo --timings` and
`CARGO_LOG=...fingerprint`. Two non-structural defects dominated real self-dev iteration far more than any
remaining crate-size effect:

1. **Right-sized the parallel-job memory budget** (`scripts/dev_cargo.sh`, commit `83857b13`). The adaptive
   limiter budgeted 2048 MiB/rustc, calibrated for the old 2.5-3 GiB monolith. With the largest unit now
   ~1.28 GiB, that stale figure capped an idle 15 GiB/8-core box at 6 jobs. Lowered to 1536 MiB/job so an
   idle machine uses all cores (and a pressured one gains a job: 4 -> 5 at ~9 GiB available) while staying
   OOM-safe (pessimistic 8-job concurrent RSS ~6.7 GiB).

2. **Stopped git activity from forcing full-tree recompiles** (`crates/jcode-build-meta/build.rs`, commit
   `8d87b2c0`). This was the dominant inner-loop tax. `jcode-build-meta` embeds version/git metadata that
   every crate consumes via `env!("JCODE_*")`. It (a) declared `.git/HEAD` + `.git/index` as
   `rerun-if-changed` inputs and (b) auto-incremented a persistent patch counter on every rerun. Cargo
   marks a build script dirty whenever a declared input is newer than its output, reruns it, and then
   force-recompiles all dependents via `StaleDepFingerprint`; the counter guaranteed the output actually
   changed each time. Net effect: any `git add`/`git status`/commit/concurrent-agent git op invalidated the
   entire graph (base -> app-core -> tui -> cli).

   Fix: derive the dev patch number deterministically from committed git state
   (`base.patch + commits-since-base-tag`, a pure function of HEAD) and drop the `.git/*` rerun triggers,
   keeping `Cargo.toml` + `JCODE_RELEASE_BUILD`/`JCODE_BUILD_SEMVER`/`JCODE_BUILD_GIT_*` env triggers so
   release/dist builds still embed exact metadata.

   Measured (selfdev, warm, this machine):

   | scenario | before | after |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | build after `git/index` touch (commit, `git add`, parallel agent) | ~18-25s | **0.65s** |
   | build after `git/HEAD` touch | ~18s | **0.87s** |
   | build after a real code edit (`jcode-base/src/lib.rs`) | ~20s | ~20s (correctly unchanged) |

   The dev `--version` git hash may lag the latest in-session commit until the next real rebuild; that is
   cosmetic and refreshed automatically by release builds (which clean/override).

Diagnostic recipe for "why did everything just recompile?":
`CARGO_LOG=cargo::core::compiler::fingerprint=info <cargo build> 2>&1 | grep -iE 'stale|dirty'`.
Look for `StaleItem(ChangedFile { reference: <build-script output>, stale: <some input> })` -- it names the
exact `rerun-if-changed` input whose mtime outran the build-script output.

## Developer Workflow Guidance

### Fast local cargo wrapper

Use:

```bash
scripts/dev_cargo.sh check --quiet
scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --release -p jcode --bin jcode --quiet
scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --profile selfdev -p jcode --bin jcode --quiet
scripts/dev_cargo.sh --print-setup
```

For narrower feature-set probes, set `JCODE_DEV_FEATURE_PROFILE` instead of spelling out Cargo flags:

```bash
JCODE_DEV_FEATURE_PROFILE=minimal scripts/dev_cargo.sh check -p jcode --lib --quiet
JCODE_DEV_FEATURE_PROFILE=pdf scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --profile selfdev -p jcode --bin jcode --quiet
JCODE_DEV_FEATURE_PROFILE=full scripts/dev_cargo.sh check -p jcode --lib --quiet
```

This is especially useful because default `jcode` enables both `embeddings` and `pdf`; in the current
dependency graph, the root tree is about **3740** lines with defaults, **1133** with PDF-only, and **1106**
with no default features. Use these profiles for measurements and local probes, while keeping full/default
builds in CI and release paths where feature coverage matters.

Developer-only root binaries are opt-in to keep `--all-targets` inner loops from compiling extra probe
entrypoints by default:

```bash
cargo run --features dev-bins --bin tui_bench -- --help
cargo run --features dev-bins --bin session_memory_bench -- --help
cargo run --features dev-bins --bin mermaid_side_panel_probe -- --help
cargo check --all-targets -p jcode --features dev-bins --quiet
```

The wrapper:

- uses `sccache` automatically when available **for non-incremental builds only**
- prefers `lld` locally on Linux x86_64
- uses the fast `selfdev` Cargo profile for self-dev build/reload workflows
- can inject a named feature profile via `JCODE_DEV_FEATURE_PROFILE` unless explicit feature args are present
- avoids hard-forcing a linker mode that may be broken on a given machine
- can print the currently selected cache/linker setup with `--print-setup`

Override linker mode explicitly when needed:

```bash
JCODE_FAST_LINKER=lld scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --release -p jcode --bin jcode
JCODE_FAST_LINKER=mold scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --release -p jcode --bin jcode
JCODE_FAST_LINKER=system scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --release -p jcode --bin jcode
```

### sccache: non-incremental only

`sccache` cannot cache incremental compilation units. All of jcode's common
profiles (`selfdev`, `dev`, `release`, `test`) set `incremental = true`, so on
the inner loop sccache produced a **0% hit rate** (measured across 272 real
compilations and clean workspace/dep rebuilds) while still adding per-rustc
wrapper overhead and a misleading "enabled" status.

`dev_cargo.sh` now decides automatically:

- **Incremental builds** (selfdev/dev/release/test, or `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1`):
  sccache is skipped (`sccache_status=skipped-incremental`), since it can never hit.
- **Non-incremental builds** (`release-lto`, or `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`): sccache is
  enabled, where it genuinely produces cache hits (CI, distribution builds).

Overrides:

```bash
JCODE_SCCACHE=on   scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --profile selfdev ...   # force-enable
JCODE_SCCACHE=off  scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --profile release-lto ... # force-disable
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --profile selfdev ...   # makes it cacheable
```

- 2026-05-29: made sccache incremental-aware. Validation on this machine:
  `--print-setup` reports `skipped-incremental` for `--profile selfdev` and `enabled`
  for `--profile release-lto`; `JCODE_SCCACHE=on` and `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` both
  re-enable it for selfdev. A clean `jcode-azure-auth` rebuild under the old
  always-on sccache showed `0/54` cache hits, confirming the prior wasted overhead.

### Remote build host fast-fail / fast-recovery

When `JCODE_REMOTE_CARGO=1` (commonly set in `~/.config/jcode/remote-build.env`),
`dev_cargo.sh` offloads builds to `JCODE_REMOTE_HOST` via `scripts/remote_build.sh`.
The preflight is designed so that remote builds "just work" when the host is up,
without paying a slow timeout when it is down:

- A cheap `bash` `/dev/tcp` reachability probe runs before the SSH preflight, so an
  offline host fails over to local cargo in about **1s** instead of waiting for the
  full SSH `ConnectTimeout` (previously ~5s on every build).
- After a recent failure, subsequent builds use a shorter recovery probe timeout
  (default **0.3s**) so repeated builds during an outage stay cheap.
- Recovery is detected on the **very next build**: an up host answers the TCP probe
  in a few milliseconds, so it immediately reverts to remote builds with no cooldown.
- The probe is skipped automatically when the SSH config uses `ProxyJump`/`ProxyCommand`
  (where a direct TCP probe to the final host would be misleading), falling back to the
  normal SSH preflight.

Tunables (all optional):

```bash
JCODE_REMOTE_TCP_TIMEOUT=1            # first-probe TCP timeout (seconds, fractional ok)
JCODE_REMOTE_RECOVERY_TCP_TIMEOUT=0.3 # probe timeout while host was recently down
JCODE_REMOTE_DOWN_TTL=300             # how long to keep using the recovery timeout
JCODE_REMOTE_TCP_PROBE=0              # disable the pre-probe; use SSH preflight only
JCODE_REMOTE_CARGO=0                  # disable remote builds entirely for one command
```

- 2026-05-29: added the TCP pre-probe + recovery-timeout logic above. Validation on this
  machine (remote host offline): warm self-dev edit-build preflight dropped from about
  **5.0s** to about **1.0s** on the first build and about **0.3s** on subsequent builds,
  while an up host still reconnects on the next build (TCP probe answered in ~10ms in
  unit tests). Function-level unit tests covered reachable/unreachable probes, the
  recent-failure window, and `desktop-tailscale` endpoint resolution.

### Target dir cleanup (`scripts/clean_target.sh`)

The `target/` directory grows without bound across profiles (dev/selfdev/release)
and cross-compile caches (`*-apple-darwin`, `*-pc-windows-*`, `linux-compat`). On
this machine it reached ~84GB. A bloated target dir does not slow compilation
directly, but it can exhaust disk and force full rebuilds when space runs out.

`scripts/clean_target.sh` reclaims space **safely while parallel builds are running**:

- It never touches a `target/<profile>` dir that has an active `rustc`/`cargo`
  process (scanned via `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`) or that was written to within a recent
  activity window (default 20min, `JCODE_CLEAN_ACTIVE_WINDOW_MIN`).
- Default mode removes only cross-compile/compat caches (regenerated on demand) and
  reports what it would free.
- `--aggressive` additionally runs `cargo clean --profile <p>` on stale profiles
  (still subject to the active-process / recent-write guards).

```bash
scripts/clean_target.sh                        # dry-run: report reclaimable space
scripts/clean_target.sh --apply                # remove cross-compile/compat caches
scripts/clean_target.sh --apply --aggressive   # also cargo-clean stale profiles
```

- 2026-05-29: reclaimed a stale `target/aarch64-apple-darwin` (2.5G) and added this
  script. Dry-runs verified it correctly SKIPs profiles with recent writes / active
  rustc while a parallel agent was building on `debug`/`selfdev`.

### Memory-adaptive cargo job count

The biggest day-to-day pain on the 8-core/15 GiB dev machine was **memory
pressure**: several self-dev agents build at once, and `.cargo/config.toml` pinned
a static `jobs = 6`. rustc on the large root `jcode` crate peaks around 2.5-3 GiB
RSS, so 6 concurrent rustc processes (across one or several builds) overshoot RAM
on a no-swap box and `earlyoom` kills the build. A static job count is wrong in both
directions: it wastes cores when the machine is idle and oversubscribes memory when
it is busy.

`scripts/dev_cargo.sh` (the path `selfdev build` uses) now sizes the job count from
**currently-available** memory each time it runs:

- `select_build_jobs()` reads `MemAvailable` and divides by a per-job memory budget
  (default **2048 MiB**, `JCODE_BUILD_MIB_PER_JOB`), then clamps into `[1, nproc]`.
- It exports `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`, which overrides `build.jobs` from `.cargo/config.toml`.
- An idle machine still uses every core; under pressure a fresh build self-throttles
  (e.g. it picked **2 jobs** at ~5.9 GiB available during a parallel-agent build).
- Explicit `JCODE_BUILD_JOBS` / `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` always win; invalid values warn and
  fall back to adaptive sizing. Non-Linux hosts keep the cargo/`.cargo` default.

The committed static fallback in `.cargo/config.toml` was also lowered from `6` to
`4` for direct `cargo` invocations that bypass the wrapper (still memory-safe for a
single build on ~15 GiB, but no longer assuming a near-full core count).

```bash
JCODE_BUILD_JOBS=2            # hard override the job count for one command
JCODE_BUILD_MIB_PER_JOB=2048  # memory budget per rustc job (default)
scripts/dev_cargo.sh --print-setup   # shows build_jobs_status + cargo_build_jobs
```

- 2026-05-29: added adaptive sizing. Verified via `--print-setup` and a stubbed-cargo
  harness that overrides win, invalid input falls through to adaptive, budget extremes
  clamp to `[1, nproc]`, and the chosen `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` is exported to the child
  cargo process. A real `dev_cargo.sh check -p jcode-logging` build succeeded.

For compile timing, prefer repeatable touched-file measurements over no-op hot-cache reruns:

```bash
scripts/bench_compile.sh check --runs 3 --touch src/server.rs
scripts/bench_compile.sh check --runs 3 --touch src/tool/read.rs
scripts/bench_compile.sh release-jcode --runs 3
scripts/bench_compile.sh selfdev-jcode --runs 3
scripts/bench_compile.sh build -- --package jcode --bin test_api
scripts/bench_selfdev_checkpoints.sh --touch src/server.rs --runs 3
```

`bench_compile.sh` now supports:

- `--runs <n>` for repeated timings with min/median/avg/max summaries
- `--touch <path>` to simulate a local edit before each timed run
- `--json` for scriptable output
- `-- <extra cargo args>` to narrow the measured target/package/bin/features

`bench_selfdev_checkpoints.sh` builds on that foundation to produce a single standard
self-dev checkpoint bundle for cold/warm check + build comparisons.

## Stop Conditions

After each structural phase we should re-measure and ask:

- Did warm `check` time improve materially?
- Did warm `build` / reload-oriented build time improve materially?
- Did we reduce rebuild scope for common self-dev edits?

If not, we should avoid continuing high-churn refactors on compile-time grounds alone.

## Results: front-end parallelism, linker, base-split, and test-build (2026-06-08)

This round focused on the warm self-dev edit loop after the crate DAG was already
in place. Every claim below is backed by a measurement; the negative results are
documented as deliberately as the wins so we do not re-attempt them.

### Profiling: where warm time actually goes

`-Ztime-passes` on `jcode-base` (selfdev profile, single-threaded, clean unit):

| pass | lib only | lib + tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macro_expand | 0.5s | 1.5s |
| type_check | 5.3s | 6.5s |
| MIR_borrow_check | 7.2s | 9.7s |
| monomorphization collect | 5.1s | 6.8s |
| codegen_crate | 2.9s | 8-12s |
| LLVM_passes | 2.8s | 3-4s |
| **total** | **~24s** | **~30-33s** |

Takeaway: a normal `build`/`check` of a monolith is **~80% single-threaded
front-end** (type-check + borrow-check + monomorphization collection). Codegen
only dominates in the **test** build (all the `#[test]` bodies become real code).

### WIN 1 — nightly parallel front-end (`-Zthreads`)

Because the bottleneck is the front-end, `rustc -Zthreads` (nightly) is the single
highest-leverage lever. Measured on this machine (Intel Ultra 7, 8 logical cores,
selfdev profile):

- `jcode-base` clean recompile: **25.3s -> 12.7s** (`-Zthreads=4`)
- base-edit full-chain rebuild end-to-end: **~16s -> ~10s**
- Diminishing returns past 4 threads on an 8-core box.

Shipped in `scripts/dev_cargo.sh` (`configure_parallel_frontend`): auto-enabled
for the `selfdev` profile when a nightly toolchain is installed, isolated to
`target/selfdev` so it cannot thrash rust-analyzer's `target/debug` cache.
Controls: `JCODE_PARALLEL_FRONTEND`, `JCODE_FRONTEND_THREADS`, `JCODE_DEV_TOOLCHAIN`.

### WIN 2 — prefer mold over lld for the bin link

The `jcode` binary is **~300 MB** of `.text` (statically links aws-sdk, `tract`
ML, ratatui, syntect, multiple rustls copies, ...). On a warm rebuild that
relinks the bin (which is nearly every incremental build):

- lld: ~2.9s
- **mold: ~2.0s**

Flipped `dev_cargo.sh` auto-detection to mold-first (lld remains the fallback).
~0.8s off every incremental build. Note: changing the linker changes RUSTFLAGS,
so the first build after this lands does a one-time full recompile. (Only the
dev/selfdev path; `release-lto` linking is left untouched — historically
`clang + mold` had release-link issues on this machine.)

### NEGATIVE — cranelift codegen backend

Tried `-Zcodegen-backend=cranelift` on both lib and test builds. It was **slower**
in both cases (lib 25.3s -> ... cranelift slower; base `--tests` 32.5s LLVM vs
34.2s cranelift). The bottleneck is the front-end, not codegen, so cranelift's
faster-codegen tradeoff loses here. **Do not enable cranelift.**

### NEGATIVE — splitting provider/auth out of `jcode-base`

Hypothesis: provider+auth account for ~70% of base churn; pulling them into a
sibling crate should stop provider edits from recompiling base-core.

Did the full analysis and the full execution:

- Mapped the module dependency graph; the provider/auth cycle is a 6-module SCC
  (`auth, provider, provider_catalog, subscription_catalog, usage, live_tests`).
- Computed the exact transitive cut: **17 modules / 114 files / ~75k LOC** must
  move up (provider, auth, usage, memory, memory_agent, compaction, sidecar,
  skill, goal, gmail, catalogs), leaving a **~28k-LOC base-core** with **zero
  remaining back-edges** (verified).
- Executed it in a worktree: created `jcode-provider-stack`, moved all 114 files,
  rewired `app-core` to re-export it. **Full build passed, binary ran, tests
  passed.**

Then measured, controlled, low load:

| layout | provider-edit rebuild |
| --- | --- |
| unsplit (base 103k) | ~10.4s |
| split (provider-stack 75k + base-core 28k) | ~10.1s |

**No win.** The `--timings` breakdown shows why: thanks to rmeta pipelining,
`app-core` already starts compiling **before** `base` finishes (base is on the
critical path for only ~2s before app-core picks up). And `app-core + tui + bin`
dominate the chain and are untouched by the split. Splitting an *intermediate*
crate just moves work off a path that was already overlapped.

**Decision: reverted.** Do not ship a 114-file move through auth/billing code for
zero measured benefit. General rule learned: **further splitting the existing
monoliths has diminishing-to-negative returns** once the parallel front-end and
rmeta pipelining are in play. The lever is crate *content/weight*, not crate
*count*.

### NEGATIVE — moving inline `#[cfg(test)]` tests to separate targets

Inline tests are large: base 1132 / app-core 830 / tui 1313 `#[test]`s,
~49k LOC of test code. They add **+5.7s (+23%)** to a `cargo test -p jcode-base`
front-end, concentrated in codegen (test bodies become real code).

But moving them out does **not** help:

1. On a normal `build`/`check` they are already `cfg`-gated out and cost **0s**.
   They only cost time when you actually run `cargo test` on that crate.
2. Converting unit tests to `tests/` integration targets is not viable: the 1132
   base tests reach private internals; integration tests only see `pub` items, so
   it would require either making huge swaths of the API public or adding
   test-only accessors — large churn that breaks encapsulation.
3. Even split out, `cargo test -p <crate>` compiles the whole test cfg unit; you
   cannot cheaply compile just one test. That is a cargo limitation, not a
   structure problem.

**Decision: leave inline unit tests as-is.** They are the correct structure for
white-box testing and impose no cost on the build loop.

### State of play after this round

For the plain `build` edit loop, the warm provider/base edit is ~10s, now a
**balanced serial chain** with no single dominant stage:

```
provider/base front-end ~3s -> app-core ~3s -> tui ~2.7s -> bin link ~2s (mold)
```

The structural levers (crate splitting, test relocation) are tapped out. The
remaining real levers are **product-level, not mechanical**:

- **Dependency/binary weight** (untested here): the 300 MB binary statically
  links the full aws-sdk, `tract` (ML, for embeddings), syntect, etc. Feature-
  gating the heaviest stacks behind off-by-default flags would cut codegen *and*
  link on every build. Highest-probability remaining win; measure before committing.
- **Dead code**: the root bin/lib is large and carries dead-code warnings;
  trimming genuinely-unused code is the one "free" structural win.

### NEGATIVE — `-C prefer-dynamic` for the dev binary

Hypothesis: the ~2s bin link is dominated by statically baking everything into a
huge binary; `prefer-dynamic` should dynamize that and cut the link.

Built the full bin with `-C prefer-dynamic` (selfdev + nightly threads + mold)
and measured the incremental relink (touch `main.rs`), back-to-back vs
static+mold under identical conditions:

| link config | warm bin relink | binary size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| static + mold | ~1.8-2.7s | 414 MB |
| prefer-dynamic + mold | ~1.8-3.0s | 413 MB |

**No win, and the binary got no smaller.** `prefer-dynamic` only dynamizes crates
that are built as dylibs (essentially Rust std); the workspace crates and the
heavy deps (aws-sdk, tract, ratatui, ...) are still `rlib`s baked into the bin,
so the link does the same work. The dynamic binary also needs its `.so` files on
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to run, which would add fragility to the `selfdev reload` path
(reload copies the binary to `~/.jcode/builds/current/`). Bad trade for zero gain.

The only way dynamic linking would help is compiling the heavy *dependency*
stacks as dylibs — which is the product-level "dependency weight" lever, not a
mechanical config change.

### Final verdict

All non-product compile levers are now exhausted and documented. Shipped wins:
the nightly parallel front-end and mold. Everything else (more crate splitting,
test relocation, cranelift, prefer-dynamic) was measured and rejected. The warm
edit loop is a balanced ~10s serial chain; the only remaining levers are
product-level (trim the statically-linked dependency weight) and are explicitly
out of scope.

## Incremental cache audit (2026-06-08)

Audited whether the incremental-build caching is configured optimally. It is —
but a multi-agent workflow detail was found that silently destroys cache reuse.

### Config: correct, nothing to change

- `selfdev` / `dev` / `test` all set `incremental = true`. ✓
- sccache is deliberately **skipped** for incremental builds (`maybe_enable_sccache`
  in `dev_cargo.sh`): sccache cannot cache incremental compilation units, so on
  our incremental profiles it would add wrapper overhead for 0% hits. Forcing it
  on requires `JCODE_SCCACHE=on` (and a non-incremental profile to be useful). ✓
- The nightly parallel front-end (`-Zthreads=4`) is incremental-compatible —
  verified: a genuinely idle no-op rebuild is **0.4s** (pure fingerprint checks),
  so `-Zthreads` does not defeat the dep-graph cache. ✓

### The real issue: shared-worktree mtime invalidation

A "no-op" rebuild (touch nothing) was observed taking **46s** instead of 0.4s.
`CARGO_LOG=cargo::core::compiler::fingerprint=info` showed the cause:

```
stale: changed ".../jcode-provider-core/src/lib.rs"
  source_mtime > fingerprint_mtime   -> StaleDepFingerprint cascades to the whole graph
```

The source content had not changed — only its **mtime** had, because **another
agent was editing files in the same shared worktree** (`/home/jeremy/jcode`)
between builds. Cargo keys freshness on mtime, so any concurrent edit to a low,
high-fanout crate (e.g. `jcode-provider-core`, `jcode-base`) invalidates that
crate and everything downstream, turning a 0.4s no-op into a full-chain rebuild.

Proven back-to-back: build #2 (idle) = **0.4s**; build #3, after a sibling
session touched `inline_interactive.rs` / `info_widget_stability.rs`, = **46.6s**.

### Correction: the shared-worktree model is intended, and it works

The 46s "no-op" above is **not a cache bug** — it is the shared-build model doing
its job. When several agents work in the **same** worktree they share one
`target/selfdev` dir, so:

- Agent A edits a file and builds -> `target/selfdev` now contains A's change.
- Agent B builds -> cargo correctly rebuilds only the crates A touched (B's binary
  must include A's edit) and reuses everything else. B is *consuming A's
  compilation*, which is the goal: "one agent compiles, everyone benefits."

Putting agents in separate worktrees would be **worse** for that goal (no
sharing at all). The selfdev build system reinforces sharing with cross-session
**dedup**: `build_dedupe_key = worktree_scope : source_fingerprint : command`.
If agent B requests a build while A is already building the same source state, B
*attaches* to A's in-flight build instead of launching a second one.

### The one real rule for keeping the shared cache efficient

The `target/selfdev` fingerprint **includes RUSTFLAGS**, and both `-Zthreads` and
`-fuse-ld=mold` are part of it (measured: changing either forces a full ~2.5 min
rebuild and leaves a competing artifact set). So the shared cache only stays warm
if **every** build of the selfdev profile uses **identical flags**:

- `selfdev build` always routes through `scripts/dev_cargo.sh`, which injects the
  standard `-Zthreads=4 + mold` flags. All agents using it share perfectly
  (idle no-op ~1s). ✓
- A bare `cargo build --profile selfdev` (bypassing `dev_cargo.sh`) uses
  different flags -> triggers a full rebuild and poisons the shared cache for the
  next `selfdev build`. **Avoid it.** Always build via `selfdev build` /
  `dev_cargo.sh`.
- rust-analyzer uses `target/debug` (a separate dir), so it does **not** poison
  `target/selfdev`. ✓

No config change is warranted; the caching itself is already optimal. The
operational rule is simply: every agent builds the same way.
